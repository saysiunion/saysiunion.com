        <p>
            We&#x27;re the SAY Sí Union, the first non-profit arts education union in Texas representing the staff 
            of SAY Sí! We are represented by <a href="https://www.upounion.org/home">United Professional Organizers</a>.

            <h1 style="margin:0;">OUR UNION'S JOURNEY</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            On September 19, 2022, the resounding majority of SAY Sí employees united in their desire to exercise 
            their fundamental right to unionize. In response, SAY Sí&#x27;s board leadership chose not to recognize all 
            members originally proposed for inclusion in the unit.
        </p>
        <p>
            To secure the full staff&#x27;s right to unionize, our staff entered into a pre-election hearing with the 
            National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). During this challenging process, both our resilient staff and the 
            board, represented by the union-busting law firm Ogletree Deakins, presented evidence in the quest to 
            determine who truly belongs in our union.
        </p>
        <p>
            After three weeks of arguing before the NLRB, months of waiting for a decision, and substantial expenditures 
            by the employer on anti-union legal consultations, the NLRB ruled decisively in our favor on every position. 
            As of February 2, 2023, we proudly represent the entire teaching staff and nearly all administrative positions 
            of SAY Sí. The SAY Sí Union is now embarking on interest-based bargaining negotiations with our employer, 
            marking the beginning of our inaugural contract discussions.
        </p>
        <div id="supercenter">
            <h1 style="margin:0;">WHAT IS INTEREST-BASED BARGAINING?</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            Interest-based bargaining(IBB) is a collaborative approach that focuses on finding common ground and mutual 
            benefits. IBB is a collaborative approach to resolving labor and management disputes. Through the process, 
            parties proactively identify durable solutions to outcomes at the bargaining table. Agreements are based on 
            mutual and individual interests rather than positions. This approach emphasizes problem solving and enables 
            mutual gain outcomes. Basically, it&#x27;s just a fancy way of saying we sit down and find common ground to benefit 
            everyone. We believe this will help us find and achieve solutions that prioritize the well-being and success 
            of our members.
