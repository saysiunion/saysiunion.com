        <p>
            On September 19, 2022, the vast majority
            of SAY Sí employees asked the SAY Sí board
            leadership to recognize their right to unionize.
            On October 3rd, the board formally responded,
            stating that while they respect the staff’s right
            to form a union, they will not recognize all
            members originally included in the proposed
            unit, including studio directors Stevan, Gisha,
            Ashley, Amalia and Anahí from admin. <br> <br> This led
            the staff into a NLRB (National Labor Relations
            Board) pre-election hearing, where both the
            staff and the board (who chose to get legal
            representation by Darlene Haas-Awada of
            Ogletree Deakins) presented evidence in their
            assessments of who deserves to be in the union.
            As of right now, the staff patiently awaits for
            the final decision to be made for their case,
            which will likely not occur until January 2023.
